                <h2> Welcome </h2>
                <p> Welcome to the Orlando Perl Mongers website. We're
                currently undergoing some re-organization as our regular
                meeting attendance fell off sharply over the last year
                or two. We hope to change this in the near future.</p>
                <h2>Perl Oasis</h2>
                <p> We are the proud sponsors of the annual <a
                href="http://perloasis.org">Perl Oasis</a> workshop
                which has had international attendance for two years
                running. We're currently in early planning stages for
                the 2011 Perl Oasis, and are looking for volunteers to
                help out</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                <p>You can contact us by showing up at a meeting (once
                one is scheduled), or by joining our <a
                href="http://groups.google.com/group/orlando-perl-mongers">mailing
                list</a>.</p>
                <h2> Meetings </h2>
                <p> Currently we're don't have a scheduled next meeting.
                We're looking to start having quarterly meetings this
                fall and are looking for a suitable venue. If you know
                of someplace with a stage and a liquor license that
                wouldn't mind being overrun by geeks every three months,
                please let us know!</p>
